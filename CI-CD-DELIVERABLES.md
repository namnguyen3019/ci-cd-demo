- ✅ API endpoint tests (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Integration tests (complete workflows)
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ Authentication and permissions (ready for future implementation)

## 🚀 Pipeline Workflow

### CI Phase (Continuous Integration)

1. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Frontend: ESLint, TypeScript compilation, Next.js build
   - Backend: Django system checks, code formatting

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with PostgreSQL service
   - Integration tests with Docker Compose
   - API endpoint validation

3. **Build Validation**
   - Docker image building
   - Multi-architecture support ready

### CD Phase (Continuous Deployment)

1. **Image Management**
   - Build Docker images for both services
   - Tag with Git SHA and latest
   - Push to AWS ECR repositories

2. **Deployment**
   - Update ECS task definitions
   - Deploy to Fargate services
   - Wait for service stability

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - Execute database migrations
   - Health check validation
   - Notification of deployment status
